## Other Projects

In the interest of maintaining a healthy work/life balance, I don't do a lot of programming outside of work these days. I have, however, built a few things that I'm proud of or have enjoyed enough to share here.

  ### IPA Reader <small> _[ipa-reader.com](https://ipa-reader.com)_ </small>

  IPA Reader is a text-to-speech reader for [International Phoenetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) notation. I use it mostly for figuring out how to pronounce things I've stumbled onto on Wikipedia, but others have found it useful for learning new languages, sharing their name pronunciations asynchronously, and even building their own [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language).

  The project started as a means to learn and practice some of the offerings available from AWS, primarily relying on Amazon Polly. The [original version](https://ipa-reader.xyz) also made use of Lambda and S3.

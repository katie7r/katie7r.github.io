## Other Projects

In the interest of maintaining a healthy work/life balance, I don't do a lot of programming outside of work these days. I have, however, built a few things that I'm proud of or have enjoyed enough to share here.

  ### IPA Reader <small> _[ipa-reader.com](https://ipa-reader.com)_ </small>

  IPA Reader is a text-to-speech reader for [International Phoenetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) notation. I use it mostly for figuring out how to pronounce things I've stumbled onto on Wikipedia, but others have found it useful for learning new languages, sharing their name pronunciations asynchronously, and even building their own [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language).

  The project started as a means to learn and practice some of the offerings available from AWS, primarily relying on Amazon Polly. The [original version](https://ipa-reader.xyz) also made use of Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

  ### My Family <small> _[karl.wedding](https://karl.wedding/)_ </small>

  Though it's not a technical marvel, I'm quite fond of this little site. It started out as the public site I set up for [our wedding](https://karl.wedding/wedding); afterwards, I converted it into an even simpler page for sharing new addition announcements and links with family and friends.

  ### My Dotfiles <small> _[github.com/katie7r/forty-six](https://github.com/katie7r/forty-six)_ </small>

  I thoroughly enjoy putting together git aliases and bash scripts to make my time in the terminal quicker, easier, and more fun. I also enjoy not having to manually re-configure every computer I work on. These two sources of enjoyment collide in my dotfiles repo, wherein I commit the git aliases, bash shortcuts, command line configurations, etc. that I've come to use every day.

  I'm particularly pleased with the [simple script](https://github.com/katie7r/forty-six/blob/main/install.sh) that makes setting up (and working with subsequent updates to) my dotfiles trivially easy for me. I also have a ton of fun [git aliases](https://github.com/katie7r/forty-six/blob/main/dotfiles/git/gitconfig) that I love sharing with other devs, so feel free to pull any you like for your own use!

## Me, Personally

I'm a Florida native and current Austinite. I'm a mom (of two), a pet parent (to a cat and a dog), and a plant parent (with, frankly, an untenable number of botanical charges). I love words and wordplay. My favorite genre is fantasy, whether reading, watching, or gaming. I, like most people, enjoy music. I generally don't like having an internet presence, and I especially dislike writing "about me" content. ðŸ™ƒ

  ### Special Interests
  - Video games (particularly CRPGs, tactical RPGs, cozy sim games, & clever puzzle games)<br />
  - D&D (I'm currently playing a lore bard/battlesmith artificer rock gnome)<br />
  - Amateur zoology, botany, & mycology (shoutout to [Seek](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) by [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)!)<br />
  - Evolution & genetics (especially animal color genetics, and _especially_ pigeons)<br />
  - Behavioral psychology<br />

Ask me about any of the above at your own risk.

## Me, Professionally

Professionally, I'm a senior software engineer and have been working at [Cuttlesoft](https://cuttlesoft.com) since 2015. I use and have experience with a wide range of technologies; my bread and butter, though, is Ruby on Rails, which I've been working in since 2013.

## About Me (Professionally)

I'm a senior software engineer at [Cuttlesoft](https://cuttlesoft.com), where I have worked since 2015. I use and have experience with a wide range of technologies, but my bread and butter is Ruby on Rails, which I've been working in since 2013.

  ### Special Interests

  User experience & interaction design, developer experience (especially reusable code, code generation, and finding reasonable excuses to employ meta-programming), gamification, simplifying complex code, and generally well-organized code

## About Me (Personally)

I'm a mom (of two) with a cat, a dog, and a frankly untenable number of plants. I am happily living in Austin, TX, though I do miss all the rain I'm used to as a Florida native. My favorite genre is fantasy, whether reading, watching, or gaming. I love words and wordplay and, like most people, enjoy music. I generally don't like having an internet presence, and I especially dislike writing "about me" content. ðŸ™ƒ

<aside>

  ### Special Interests

  Video games (particularly CRPGs, tactical RPGs, cozy sim games, and clever puzzle games), D&D (I'm currently playing a lore bard/battlesmith artificer rock gnome), amateur zoology/botany/mycology (shoutout to [Seek](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) by [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)!), evolution & genetics (especially animal color genetics, and _especially_ pigeons), and behavioral psychology

Ask me about any of the above at your own risk!
